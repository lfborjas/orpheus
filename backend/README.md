# Orpheus Backend

This is an API written with [Servant](https://github.com/haskell-servant/servant). 

Uses

* [servant-auth](https://github.com/haskell-servant/servant-auth#readme) for authentication
* [servant-elm](https://github.com/haskell-servant/servant-elm) to generate types to be consumed by the frontend.

## Development

To run the API server, run:
 
    stack exec
